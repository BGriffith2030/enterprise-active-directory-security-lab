# Enterprise Windows Infrastructure Project

This repository documents the successful design, deployment, configuration, and documentation of a **Windows Server 2022 Active Directory Domain Controller** within an isolated enterprise lab environment using **Oracle VirtualBox**.

The project demonstrates practical experience deploying enterprise Windows infrastructure, including **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DNS, static IPv4 networking, Organizational Units (OUs), user administration, security groups, virtualization, and technical documentation**.

The objective was not simply to install Windows Server, but to build a repeatable enterprise deployment while documenting every stage of the implementation using professional GitHub documentation practices.

# Lessons Learned

Completing this project reinforced several important enterprise concepts.

- Active Directory depends heavily on DNS.
- Infrastructure servers should always use static IP addresses.
- Proper planning reduces deployment complexity.
- Organizational Units improve administration and scalability.
- Security groups simplify access management.
- Documentation is essential for repeatable deployments.
- Structured troubleshooting is more effective than trial-and-error.

These lessons directly apply to Windows Server administration, enterprise IT operations, help desk support, and cybersecurity environments.

# Project Overview

## Introduction

The Active Directory Domain Controller Lab is a virtualized environment designed to simulate a small enterprise Windows infrastructure. This project focuses on deploying a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller, configuring Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), setting up DNS, and onboarding a Windows 11 workstation into the domain.

The purpose of this lab is to build hands-on experience with identity management, system administration, networking fundamentals, and enterprise IT operations.

## Lab Goals

This project aims to:

- Deploy a fully functional Windows Server 2022 domain controller
- Configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Implement DNS for domain operations
- Create Organizational Units (OUs), users, and security groups
- Build and configure a Windows 11 domain workstation
- Demonstrate core identity and access management concepts
- Document each configuration step with screenshots and explanations

## Architecture Overview

The lab uses VirtualBox to host both the domain controller and the Windows 11 workstation. Networking is configured using NAT + Host-Only adapters to allow:

- Internet access for updates  
- Internal communication between DC01 and WIN11  
- DNS resolution inside the domain  

The domain controller manages authentication, identity, and directory services for the environment.
